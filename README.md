I'm Xopnek
It's just an internet alias, it doesn't mean anything. 

I am interested in Computer Science and Software Development.
 
I'm currently learning web development with a job
 
I will be more active on here upon developing more skills and starting my project
 
I already have a few ideas, stay tuned.
 
I will try to collaborate on any project that I can. 
 
I will also update this repository periodically with new information
 
Thank you for reading
